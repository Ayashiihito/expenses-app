# Expenses Calculator
### This is a quite basic full-stack application written with:  
#### Front-end:
  * React
  * Redux
  * Material-Ui

#### Back-end:
  * Node
  * Express
  * MongoDB (with Mongoose)
 
 authentication with JWT and passport.js
 
Install with `npm install && client-install`.  
Run in development with `npm run dev`.

Back-end routes:
  * GET `/api/expenses`
  * GET `/api/exptypes`
  * POST `/api/users/login`
  * POST `/api/user/register`
  * POST `/api/expenses`
  * POST `/api/exptypes`
  * DELETE `/api/expenses/:id`
  
  Back-end part is mostly done by following this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/),  
  but with some deviations here and there.
